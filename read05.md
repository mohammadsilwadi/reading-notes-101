**Loops and iteration**

**for statement**>*A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.*
A for statement looks as follows:

**for** *([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])*

*statement*

*The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. *

**while statement**
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

**while** *(condition)*
 
 *statement*

*The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.*
