# **HTML**

+ **HTML**>*is the structure of our web pages once the designer finishes the design we can start writing the code for the design using HTML language.*
 
 # **Extra Markup In HTML 5**
 **DOCTYPES >** *Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.*

**In HTML 5 we use** <! DOCTYPE html > .

**Comments in HTML >** *If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:*

<!- -comment goes here -->

**Block Elements >** *Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
Examples of block elements are
h1, p, ul, and li.*

**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block >**
*The div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
In a browser, the contents of
the div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.
Using an id or class attribute
on the div> element, however,
means that you can create
CSS style rules to indicate how
much space the div> element
should occupy on the screen and
change the appearance of all the
elements contained within it.
It can also make it easier to
follow your code if you have used
div> elements to hold each
section of the page.*
# **HTML5 Layout**
*HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
HTML5 Semantic Elements* 	

    header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
    nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
    section> - Defines a section in a document
    article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
    aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
    footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
    details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
    summary> - Defines a heading for the details> element.

## WRITING A SCRIPT
*To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.*
1. DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.

3. CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

###  How do cpmpiters fit in with the world around them.
* computers create models of wolrd using data.
