# **HTML**

+ **HTML**>*is the structure of our web pages once the designer finishes the design we can start writing the code for the design using HTML language.*
 
 # **Extra Markup In HTML 5**
 **DOCTYPES >** *Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.*

**In HTML 5 we use** <! DOCTYPE html > .

**Comments in HTML >** *If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:*

<!- -comment goes here -->

**Block Elements >** *Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
Examples of block elements are
h1, p, ul, and li.*

**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block >**
*The div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
In a browser, the contents of
the div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.
Using an id or class attribute
on the div> element, however,
means that you can create
CSS style rules to indicate how
much space the div> element
should occupy on the screen and
change the appearance of all the
elements contained within it.
It can also make it easier to
follow your code if you have used
div> elements to hold each
section of the page.*
# **HTML5 Layout**
*HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
HTML5 Semantic Elements* 	

    header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
    nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
    section> - Defines a section in a document
    article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
    aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
    footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
    details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
    summary> - Defines a heading for the details> element.

# JavaScript
**JavaScript**> *JavaScript is an asynchronous, dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language, designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive*.

**JavaScript**> *is a programming language that could use Expressions and operators to do the tasks*.


**JavaScript Operators**>   **such as**

*The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable*.

EX: 

var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x

And *The addition operator (+) adds numbers* 

EX:

var x = 5;

var y = 2;

var z = x + y;

And we have also

**Comparison Operators**>> **such as**

*== 	equal to*

*=== 	equal value and equal type*

*!= 	not equal*

*!== 	not equal value or not equal type*

*> 	greater than*

*< 	less than*

*>= 	 greater than or equal to*

*<= 	less than or equal to*

*? 	ternary operator*

**Logical Operators**>> **such as**

*&& 	logical and*

*|| 	logical or*

*! 	logical not*

**Control flow**>*Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.*
