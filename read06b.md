 **What is CSS for**>>*Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.*

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

the color of the h1 element will be red and the font size will be 5 em.
