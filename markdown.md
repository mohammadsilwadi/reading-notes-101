 #  **MarkDown-Note**

Markdown (Links to an external site.) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

 like for  heading, we  use # ## heading 2 ##

for bold text, we use ** **text**
